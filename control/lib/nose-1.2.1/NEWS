This release was a long time in coming, and wouldn't have been
possible at all without the contributions of numerous developers and
community members. Please check out the changelog to see what's new
and who to thank.

If you're interested in the future of nose, please take a look at the
nose2 project on github (https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) or pypi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose2/0.4.1).

And lastly if you have the money to spare, please consider donating to
the John Hunter memorial fund (http://numfocus.org/johnhunter/). We
all give up time with our families to work on free software: so now
the free software community that has benefited so much from that
time we took can give something back to his family.
